Project Description:
Build a web-based collaborative code editor (similar to CodePen or JSFiddle but simpler) that allows multiple users to code together in real-time. This project will showcase numerous advanced JavaScript concepts and modern web technologies.

Key Features:

1. Real-time Collaboration
- WebSocket integration for live code synchronization
- Cursor position sharing between users
- Real-time chat functionality
- User presence indicators
1. Code Editor Features
- Syntax highlighting using a library like Prism.js or CodeMirror
- Multiple language support
- Auto-completion
- Code formatting
- Error detection and linting
1. Advanced Features
- Code execution in isolated environments (using Web Workers)
- Save/load functionality with version history
- Share sessions via unique URLs
- Split screen view for HTML/CSS/JS
- Live preview with hot reload
